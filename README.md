# Distributed-File-System

Distributed File Service with 2PC Deletion

How to run:

1. There will be two parts: 
  a. Chat_Client
  b. Chat_Server

2. Go to Netbeans, and select File --> Open Project.

3. Select the two Java files listed under Step 1.

4. Change the file path under both the client and the server to where you want the client
to store the files. The file path will obviously vary for Windows and Mac systems (and
the existing project is done on a Mac).

5. Go to Libraries --> Right-click and Add JAR/Folder, and select the included JAR file
(org.apache.commons.io.jar).

6. Once the two projects are up, click on the individual Java frame classes on each project
(for client and server), and click Run on client_frame.java and server_frame.java

7. The Client and the Server should start running.
